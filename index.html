        <p>My hobbies are video games, reading and biking/excersising. I like reading as it brings you into a erntirley new world of imagination and wonder. I play video games because it can be social you can do it online making it fun to comunicate with friends. It also have puzzle solving quests and what not. I like biking because my friend got me back into biking and it is super fun. I like excersising because it makes me fit and produces a chemical that makes me happy.</p>
